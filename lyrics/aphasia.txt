So satisfied
I said a lot of things tonight
So long aphasia
And the ways it kept me hiding

It's not so much exactly all the words I used
It's more that I was somehow down to let them loose

So complicated
I can't wait to get explaining
You're listening
To send it out since I've been crying

So long aphasia
And the ways it kept me hidden
So long my silent nerves
And hesitance, oblivion

Came and sent me out unfurling in the street
I felt unprecedented confidence in speaking

Stick around
I'm thinking things'll be alright
We redelivered
Won't you live with me tonight?

Something tonight
Was such a let down on my pride
Takes a part of me
Don't got to take some things in stride

I pace around her place, so quiet in my cell
Wake the next and see my silence when I'm felt
Just when I thought I had this pattern sorted out
Apparently my ventricles are full of doubt, now

Now I feel so alone sometimes
Don't let it freak you out
But if I don't have you by me
Then I'm going to crawl

Now what you've got was in your reaches all along
Plus one day you'll be reaching for me and I'll be gone
So to help remind myself, I wrote this little song

One day I won't need your love
One day I won't define myself by the one I'm thinking of
And if one day I won't need it
Then one day you won't need it
